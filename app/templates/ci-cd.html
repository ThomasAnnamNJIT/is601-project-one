            <p class="fw-normal"><strong>CI/CD</strong> also known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery
                is the cornerstone of the DevOps approach. Continuous Integration involves the lifecycle from when a
                developer develops/pushes their code to their repository
                and all the unit tests/integration pass. Continuous Delivery involves taking all of your code after it
                has been developed and passes integration testing,
                and deployed into a different environment such as Dev, QA, or Production.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-normal"><strong>Continuous Integration</strong> as defined by Martin Fowler is
            <blockquote style="background: #eee">
                <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                    ...a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually
                    each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day
                    (https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            With this constant integration on a day-to-day basis, some benefits that this produces as described by
            Martin Fowler can be summarized as the following:
            <ul class="px-5">
                <li>Better collaboration between software development teams</li>
                <li>Smaller code changes</li>
                <li>Frequent deployments</li>
                <li>Less bugs (code defects) and easier to debug</li>

            <p class="fw-normal"><strong>Github Actions</strong> is a service that GitHub provides in order for teams or
                developers
                to have the ability for CI/CD deployments via a pipeline on GitHub. GitHub Actions are similar to other CI/CD
                pipelines such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or Concourse.
                GitHub Actions are compromised of workflows that you can add to your GitHub Repository.
                GitHub Actions is purely event based driven, which means your workflow responds to a specific event
                after it has been triggered. Some events that your workflow can correspond to include the following:
            <ul class="px-5">
                <li>Issues</li>
                <li>PR creation</li>
                <li>Scheduled Events (i.e. cron job)</li>
            </ul>
            All workflows must be defined in YAML syntax under <em>.github/workflows</em>

                    A workflow must respond to an event, as discussed in the section above, this event can be anything that ranges from
                    issues, PRs, or scheduled events.
                    This is defined in the <em>on</em> section of the YAML file of the workflow. The <em>on</em> section
                    as shown above says to trigger this workflow
                    whenever a PR request is raised from any feature branch that wants to be <strong>merged</strong> into main.

                    Github Actions are commands that are developed by you or the community to perform a task. Each
                    action is performed within a step, which are individual tasks of a workflow.
                    Each of these steps performed make up a job. In the diagram shown above, we are using an action that
                    will allow us to deploy our application onto Heroku, where we specify the configurations within
                    our <strong>heroku.yml</strong> file with the build context being our <strong>Dockerfile</strong>.

                    Now that we are familiar to how to set up a GitHub workflow and as well as understand some terms associated with them such as
                    actions, jobs, tasks, and steps, we will now discuss the production workflow. With the production workflow, we want to trigger whenever commits have been pushed into main or
                    whenever tags have been pushed into main. We then perform a series of steps to first run all the unit tests within the project using pytest, and then deploying our docker image into DockerHub, as shown above
                    in our <strong>runtest</strong> and <strong>build-container</strong> jobs. Lastly, same as with the development workflow, we will also be deploying this application
                    into Heroku.
