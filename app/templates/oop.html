            <p class="fw-normal"><strong>Object Orientated Programming</strong> is a software technique that allows
                software development teams/developers
                to model their functional and business requirements (i.e code) based on objects is one of the most
                important benefits within the development cycle, which are done via classes.
                These are done via <em>classes</em> and <em>methods</em>.
                Classes allow developers to build blueprints around the object(s) to be modeled (i.e. abstractions)
                which
                are defined via fields, instance methods, static methods, etc.
                Meanwhile, methods are actions/behaviors that are defined for a given class. Methods are used to define
                instructions
                to perform a repetitive operation in order to fetch a result, which can be generalized in one way or
                form.
                Now that we are familiar with OOP and some cornerstones that OOP entails (i.e. classes and methods), we
                will be discussing the
                following terms:

                        Classes are blueprints around the object(s) to be modeled. Abstraction is a way to provide
                        common interfaces of methods and APIs,
                        which are then implemented by their subclasses.
                        Here's an example of how to define an <strong>abstract class</strong> in Python:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/AbstractExample.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        We first create a regular class in Python and then extend it with <strong>ABC</strong>, by doing
                        so
                        we cannot instantiate this class directly, and have marked this class an abstract class. When we
                        extend Vehicle, all of its subclass must implement
                        the <em>num_of_wheels</em> method, otherwise it cannot be instantiated. Here's an example of a
                        subclass for a vehicle:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/Car.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        Now that we are familiar with how abstraction works, please refer <a href="#abstraction"
                                                                                             class="link-primary">here</a>
                        to how we use abstraction
                        in our
                        calculator class.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Inheritance</dt>
                    <dd class="col-sm-9 p-2">
                        Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. Some
                        features' inheritance provides includes
                        the following:
                        <ul class="px-5">
                            <li>"...represents real-world relationships well"</li>
                            <li>"...It provides reusability of a code.
                                We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again.
                                Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it"
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        In other words, from a Python point of view, this means all the fields that are
                        <strong>public</strong> and <strong>protected</strong> are
                        automatically inherited from the parent class to the child class. Here's an example of how
                        inheritance is used:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/Car.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="col-sm-3">Polymorphism</dt>
                    <dd class="col-sm-9 p-2">
                        Polymorphism allows an object to take on many forms. This is true when one class is
                        inherited from another, as stated above,
                        inheritance provides an <em>is a</em> relationship, therefore, when class B extends A, it can be
                        referenced as both Class B or Class A. Here's an example of polymorphism using our vehicle
                        example:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/PolymorphismCar.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        With the above example, we can create a Car object by either Car or Vehicle, however, as stated
                        above
                        since Car <strong>extends</strong> Vehicle, we also know Vehicle can be in the shape of a Car.
                        Now that we are familiar with how polymorphism works, please refer here to how polymorphism is
                        used in our
                        calculator class.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="col-sm-3">Encapsulation</dt>
                    <dd class="col-sm-9 p-2">
                        Encapsulation means only methods in the class with the variables can refer to the instance
                        variable.
                        In other words, only certain fields of a given classes are able to called from other parts of
                        your program.
                        The three scopes that Python has includes public (this is the default), protected, and private.
                        Public allows a field/method to be accessed anywhere in your program.
                        Protected allows access for only the class itself as well as any subclasses. Lastly, private
                        access only allows for the class itself to access it's methods.
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/EncapsulationPartOne.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/EncapsulationPartTwo.png" width="700" height="500" class="rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        With the above example, we see that name is a private variable, and that the only way it can be
                        passed is either within the Vehicle class itself (i.e. the <strong>base</strong> class),
                        or by accessing it via a getter method within its subclasses.
