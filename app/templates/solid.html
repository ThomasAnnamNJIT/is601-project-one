                C. Martin and Michael Feathers.
                These SOLID principles allow developers principles to "...create more maintainable, understandable, and
                flexible software". The principles of SOLID that we will discuss in depth include the following:

                        This is demonstrated within our
                        Calculator example, where we have three subclasses which all extend from CalculatorOperation
                        (i.e. abstract base class/interface),
                        which are Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication. All these subclasses have only single
                        responsibility
                        which is to either <strong>add, subtraction, or multiply</strong>, respectively. In essence,
                        each class provides
                        its own functionality without affecting the other classes.

                        In our Calculator example, we provide an abstract base class called CalculatorOperation, which
                        is initialized with a set of values.
                        From this, we provide a method called <strong>perform_operation</strong>, which is an abstract
                        method, whose functionality is defined by its subclasses.
                        From the earlier discussed in Single Responsibility, the subclasses involve Addition,
                        Subtraction, and Multiplication. The Addition class will perform the functionality for adding
                        numbers,
                        the subtraction class will perform the functionality for subtracting numbers, and lastly,
                        multiplication will perform the functionality for d
                        multiplying numbers. With this design approach of a common base class, we can easily extend this
                        to include other operations such as Division.

                        In our Calculator example, we see that <strong>perform_operation</strong> is an abstract method,
                        which means that it <strong>must</strong> be implemented by all of it's subclasses.
                        Therefore, if we had a single method that takes a CalculatorOperation has an argument, then any
                        of its subclasses (i.e. Addition, Subtraction, or Multiplication) should all work as expected
                        since it would call its implementation of the
                        <strong>perform_operation</strong> method. This is also known as method overriding.

                        In our Calculator example, the only method that each subclass must implement is the <strong>perform_operation</strong>
                        method.
                        This ensures each subclass is performing that operation that is intended to perform. The
                        subclass is not expected to implement/override
                        any of the methods from its base class, if applicable.

                        In our Calculator example, we have a constructor that accepts a list of tuples of numbers,
                        and a single abstract method called <strong>perform_operation</strong>. All subclasses that
                        extend Calculator
                        must implement any of the abstract methods within the Calculator. In summation, the subclasses
                        (low-level modules)
                        depends on the details of the base class (high-level modules), however, the base class does not
                        need to know the implementation
                        of the low-level modules.
