                        A class is a blueprint that allow developers to build on abstractions they want to model for
                        an object, to meet both business and functional requirements
                        for their application.

                        An object can be thought of as an instance of a class. An object is characterized via two
                        things, which are
                        its properties (i.e. fields), and its behaviors (i.e. methods). All objects in Python (i.e. int,
                        float, List, Tuple, etc.),
                        all inherit from a base Object class. To create an user-defined Object in Python, one can do the
                        following:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/ObjectCreation.png" class="img-fluid rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        The above example creates a new Car object, this is the equivalent of <strong>new Car()</strong>
                        in
                        Java.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="col-sm-3">Instantiation</dt>
                    <dd class="col-sm-9 p-2">
                        Instantiation in Python is used to initialize/create an object. This is typically done within
                        the
                        <em>__init__</em> method. We can define a <em>__init__</em> by doing the following:
                        <p class="fw-normal p-3">
                            <img src="static/images/ObjectCreation.png" class="img-fluid rounded"
                                 alt="...">
                        </p>
                        Since Car extends Vehicle, which is an abstract base class, <strong>super</strong> must be
                        called,
                        which is essentially a call to the parent class,
                        and passes an argument, which is essentially the name of the class itself.
                        </p>

                        Constructors in Python is used to initialize values for a given an object.
                        This is typically done within an __init__ method as we discussed above, where we can supply
                        values
                        to the method itself. In Python, we have two types of constructors:
                        <ul class="px-5">
                            <li>Default Constructor</li>
                            <li>Parameterized Constructor</li>
                        </ul>
                        To summarized both of these constructor types, the default constructor only accepts an argument
                        of itself,
                        which is <em>self</em>, and no other arguments, while the parameterized constructor accepts an
                        argument of itself and any other number
                        of arguments provided by the developer. To learn more about these constructors, please refer to
                        following link shown <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-python/"

                        An instance method/property is acted upon an instance of a class. All fields within a class can
                        be accessed via
                        via <em>self</em>, which is the equivalent to <em>this</em> in Java. In addition, unlike static
                        properties,
                        each class has its own set of properties and methods without sharing state between other objects
                        of the same class.

                        Unlike an instance method/property, a static method/property is acted upon a class as opposed to
                        an object itself.
                        In other words, all classes share the same static variables is acted upon an instance of a
                        class.
                        One typical example is updating a counter variable, whenever a new object is created,
                        this counter will be updated, however, if this counter was an instance variable, it is not
                        maintained across all objects
                        upon creation.

                        Encapsulation means only methods in the class with the variables can refer to the instance
                        variable. In other words, only certain fields of a given classes are able to called from other
                        parts of
                        your program. The three scopes that Python has includes public (this is the default), protected,
                        and private.

                        Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.

                    <dd class="col-sm-9 p-2">
                        Polymorphism allows an object to take on many forms, this means for a given Python method,
                        we can base in the base class as an argument, and when we use the base class and call a method,
                        it will have a different behavior.
                        This is shown in the Calculator example, with the <strong>perform_operations</strong> method
                        between Addition, Subtraction, or Multiplication.

                        Classes are blueprints around the object(s) to be modeled. Abstraction is a way to provide
                        common interfaces of methods and APIs,
                        which are then implemented by their subclasses.
